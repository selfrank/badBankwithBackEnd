# Bad Bank with Back End

# About
This project is a reconfiguration of a front end only bad banking application. The project utilizes react and javascript for the front end. We utilized mongodb, firebase oAuth2 athorization, and express for the backend.

We took this approach to learn more about how to build front end application for proof of concept approval and then looked at how it needs to be reconfigured to build out the backend. 

This project was part of the MITxPro learning course.
